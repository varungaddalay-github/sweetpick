We travel all over and it seems customer service at higher end restaurants is suffering. This place was perfect. The manager seated us quickly and pulled out the table for my wife. Plates were set with the restaurants name at the top. Our server, Blerta was a personable angel, friendly, wanted to know what we wanted to point us to the best dishes and has exactly correct suggestions. Drinks arrived quickly and correct. Our salad was a special, a watermelon salad, which was very good. Blerta asked how it was going, kept an eye on us and asked when we would be ready for our entres which then arrived exactly in time and prepared and presented beautifully. The chef was not behind the counter in the kitchen but on the restaurant side watching all dishes before they went out, making sure they were astonishing before being delivered. The whole staff seemed to work together like a family or friends to coordinate a top notch experience which was also relaxed. I can't say enough nice things, we went before a Broadway show, I highly recommend this restaurant.",
